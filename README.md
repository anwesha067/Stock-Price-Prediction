# Stock-Price-Prediction
In this machine learning project, we will develop stock prediction model with neural network to predict the returns on stocks.
# Stock Price Prediction Dashboard

A machine learning project that combines LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks for stock price prediction with an interactive Plotly Dash dashboard for visualization and analysis.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time stock price prediction using LSTM neural networks
- Interactive dashboard for stock analysis
- Multiple stock comparison capabilities
- Historical price visualization
- Volume analysis tools
- High/Low price tracking
- Support for major tech stocks (Tesla, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft)

## 📊 Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: Plotly Dash web interface
- **Backend**: Python-based LSTM model
- **Machine Learning**: Keras/TensorFlow implementation
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Plotly Graph Objects

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Understanding of:
  - Machine Learning concepts
  - Neural Networks (specifically LSTM)
  - Data preprocessing
  - Stock market basics

## 📚 Required Libraries

```bash

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anwesha067/Stock-Price-Prediction.git
cd stock-price-prediction
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Prepare your data:
   - Place your stock data CSV files in the project directory

## 💡 Usage

1. **Stock Prediction Model (stock_pred.py)**:
   - Trains LSTM model on historical stock data
   - Saves trained model for dashboard use
   - Includes data preprocessing and visualization

2. **Dashboard Application (stock_app.py)**:
   - Provides interactive visualization of stock data
   - Displays actual vs predicted stock prices
   - Allows comparison between different stocks
   - Features volume analysis and price tracking

## 📊 Dashboard Features

The dashboard consists of two main tabs:

1. **NSE-TATAGLOBAL Stock Data**:
   - Actual closing price visualization
   - LSTM-predicted closing price comparison
   - Interactive date range selection

2. **Stock Comparison**:
   - Multi-stock selection dropdown
   - High/Low price comparison
   - Volume analysis
   - 6-month and 1-month view options
